          Home Construction for Widows
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg">
          A home is more than just four walls; it's a place of security, dignity, and hope. 
          Unfortunately, many widows in our communities struggle to find a safe shelter, 
          often living in deteriorating conditions that put their families at risk.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          Our Home Construction Initiative is dedicated to building secure homes for widows 
          who lack proper housing. These homes provide them with a safe environment to raise their children 
          and rebuild their lives with dignity.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          One of our most touching stories is that of Mama Belinda, a widow who had been living in a crumbling 
          mud house with her three children. When we first met her, she expressed deep worries about their safety, 
          especially during the rainy season.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          Thanks to the generosity of our supporters and volunteers, we built her a shelter, 
          complete with proper roofing and essential amenities. Today, Mama Belinda and her children live without 
          fear of the next storm, and her smile serves as a powerful reminder of why we do what we do.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mt-4">
          This is just one of many success stories. Through our ongoing efforts, we aim to reach more widows in need,
          ensuring that every woman, no matter her circumstances, has a safe place to call home.
        </p>
