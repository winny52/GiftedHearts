          Every child deserves love, care, and support. Our <strong>Orphanage Visits Program</strong> 
          is dedicated to providing emotional encouragement, essential resources, and a nurturing 
          environment for children in orphanages.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Beyond donations, we engage children in <strong>storytelling, games, art, and music sessions</strong>, 
          creating joyful moments that instill a sense of belonging.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Our volunteers also help with <strong>cleaning, painting, and small repairs</strong> to create a 
          healthier and more comfortable living environment.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          In addition to fun activities, we provide <strong>mental health support and career guidance</strong> 
          to help children develop resilience and hope for the future.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 font-semibold text-center md:text-left">
          Together, we can make a differenceâ€”one child at a time.
